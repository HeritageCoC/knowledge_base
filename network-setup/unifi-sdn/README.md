The network can be modified by utilizing the onsite [UniFi Cloud Key Gen2 Pro](../../hardware/electrical-room/unifi-cloud-key-gen2-plus.md) which runs the SDN Controller software. It can be accessed with either the [mobile application](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/unifi/id1057750338?mt=8) or the [web interface](https://192.168.1.91:8443) if you are located onsite and on a non-guest network.
