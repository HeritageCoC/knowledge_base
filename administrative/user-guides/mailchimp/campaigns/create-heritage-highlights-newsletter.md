# Heritage Highlights newsletter

Heritage Highlights is the weekly newsletter that is published by the church in order to send out announcements such as upcoming birthdays/anniversaries, prayer requests, and upcoming events. We leverage [Mailchimp's](../../../../vendor-management/mailchimp.md) capabilities to create and send out the newsletter each week to our subscriber list.

## Step 1: Login to Mailchimp
