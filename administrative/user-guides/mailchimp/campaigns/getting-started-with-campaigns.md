# Getting Started with Campaigns

Mailchimp is an all-in-one marketing platform that helps us share emails and other messages with our congregation. We call these messages "campaigns." When you create a campaign in Mailchimp, you have lots of flexible settings and design options, as well as builder tools that walk you through every step of the process.
