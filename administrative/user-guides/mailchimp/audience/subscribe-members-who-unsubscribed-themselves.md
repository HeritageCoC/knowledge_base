# Subscribe members who unsubscribed themselves

Sometimes our members inadvertently unsubscribe themselves from our email campaigns. Unfortunately, as a Mailchimp admin, it’s not quite as simple as checking a box to re-subscribe those members.

The following steps should allow you to manually add back a member to our Mailchimp Audience in those instances.

## Step 1: Login to Mailchip

* [ ] Login to [Mailchimp](../how-do-i-login.md) and go to the Audiences tab
* [ ] You should see a list of members in our audience
* [ ] Sort by the “Email Marketing” column to find those members who have _**unsubscribed**_

## Step 2: Go to the signup form

Go to the form at this [link](http://eepurl.com/grQ7vP)

## Step 3: Signup members

* [ ] Fill out the form for each member from Step 1
* [ ] Hit “subscribe” after you have checked the appropriate boxes which show interests.

Make sure to use the exact same first name, last name, and email address as written in the Mailchimp list when filling out the form
{% endhint %}

## Step 4: Login to People \(Planning Center\)

* [ ] Login to [People](https://login.planningcenteronline.com/login/new) and use the search function to find a specific person's profile page from Step 1
* [ ] Click the Privacy Tab \(bottom right of screen\) and make sure the member has “Receive Heritage Highlights”

## Step 5: Refresh lists in People

{% hint style="info" %}
Perform this step once all profile pages have been updated
{% endhint %}

* [ ] Go to [Lists](https://people.planningcenteronline.com/lists) within People and search for the one title [Heritage Highlights Recipients](https://people.planningcenteronline.com/lists/853426)
* [ ] Click on the list and then hit the green **Refresh results** button 
* [ ] Click the **Settings** tab visible at the top of the member list
* [ ] Find the area the **Mailchimp status**
* [ ] If you see “Synced” in green next to Mailchimp Sync Status, you can skip to Step 6
* [ ] Press the sync button which adds the member's email and appropriate tags into the Mailchimp Audience

## Step 6: Send new campaigns

Happily send email campaigns again in Mailchimp
