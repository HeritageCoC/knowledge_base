# Subscribe members who unsubscribed themselves

Sometimes our members inadvertently unsubscribe themselves from our email campaigns. Unfortunately, as a Mailchimp admin, it’s not quite as simple as checking a box to re-subscribe those members.

The following steps should allow you to manually add back a member to our Mailchimp Audience in those instances.

1. Login to [Mailchimp](../how-do-i-login.md) and go to the Audiences tab. You should see a list of members in our audience and can sort by the “Email Marketing” column to find those members who have “unsubscribed”.
2. Go to the form at this [link](http://eepurl.com/grQ7vP).
3. Using the list above, fill out the form with the member’s first and last name and email address as written in the Mailchimp list. Hit “subscribe” after you have checked the appropriate boxes which show interests.
4. Login to People \(Planning Center\) and go to the specific person’s profile page
5. Click the Privacy Tab \(bottom right of screen\) and make sure the member has “Receive Heritage Highlights”
6. Once all members have been updated, go to the Lists within People \(Planning Center and refresh the list title Heritage Highlights Recipients. 
7. There should be a Settings tab visible at the top of the list of Members. Click that tab and look for the box that says Mailchimp Sync Status. It should say “Synced” in green unless you had to make profile changes up in Step 5. If it is “synced”, there should be a sync button available that will make sure everything is current.
8. Happily send email campaigns again in Mailchimp.
